# Kris Chen

Hi, My name is **Kris Chen**. I am a third year CS student at UC San Diego. For outdoor activities, I like hiking, swimming and surfing. Surfing was one of the best things I ever did at UCSD, and it brought me so much fun.

As a programmer, My favorite programming language is python, C++, java. At this moment, I was an undergraduate research assistant in the lab, training models about cybersecurity and attacks. In the future, I am very interested in AI and hope to be an AI engineer.
